                <div class="content-text">
                <p>Hyperhidrosis is a condition characterised by excessive sweating, often occurring in the underarms, palms, soles of the feet, and sometimes the face. Botox (botulinum toxin) has become a popular and effective treatment for managing this condition, particularly when other treatments like antiperspirants or medications fail to provide relief.</p>

            <h2>How Botox Works for Hyperhidrosis</h2>

                <div class="content-text">
            <p>Botox treats hyperhidrosis by blocking the nerve signals that stimulate sweat glands. When injected into areas prone to excessive sweating, Botox temporarily stops these glands from producing sweat.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Axillary Hyperhidrosis</b> (underarm sweating): This is one of the most common uses of Botox for hyperhidrosis and typically results in significant reductions in sweat production.</li>
                    <li><b>Palmar Hyperhidrosis</b> (excessive sweating of the hands): Botox can also be used to reduce sweating in the palms, though some people may experience temporary weakness in hand muscles.</li>
                    <li><b>Plantar Hyperhidrosis</b> (excessive sweating of the feet): Though less commonly treated with Botox due to discomfort, it can still be effective for plantar hyperhidrosis.</li>
                    <li><b>Facial Sweating:</b> Botox can help control excessive sweating on the face or scalp, though the procedure requires precision to avoid affecting facial expressions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Procedure</h2>

                <img src="Ritratti Website/10. Excessive Sweating/3. sweating.jpg" alt="Procedure">
                <div class="content-text">
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Consultation:</b> A doctor will assess the areas of excessive sweating and determine if Botox is the right treatment. Often, the iodine-starch test is used to identify the most affected areas by applying iodine and starch to the skin, which turns dark where sweat is produced.</li>
                    <li><b>Injection:</b> A series of small injections are administered just under the skin in the problem areas. The number of injections depends on the size of the area being treated. For example, treating the underarms typically requires 15 to 20 injections per side.</li>
                    <li><b>Procedure Time:</b> The process is relatively quick, usually lasting 30-45 minutes, and doesn’t require anesthesia, though a numbing cream or ice can be used to reduce discomfort. Botox can be used to treat sensitive areas like the palms or soles.</li>
                    <li><b>Recovery:</b> After the procedure, patients can resume most normal activities immediately. Some tenderness, swelling, or mild bruising may occur, but these side effects are temporary.</li>
                </ul>
            </div></div></div>

                    <div class="content-text">
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Timeframe:</b> Results generally begin to appear within 2 to 7 days after treatment, with full effects visible after about 2 weeks.</li>
                    <li><b>Duration:</b> Botox typically reduces sweating in the treated areas for more than 6 months. After this period, the treatment can be repeated to maintain results.</li>
                    <li><b>Efficacy:</b> Studies show that Botox can reduce sweating by up to 80-90% in treated areas. It’s particularly effective for axillary hyperhidrosis, and many patients report significant improvement in quality of life.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Pain or Discomfort:</b> There may be some discomfort at the injection sites, particularly in sensitive areas like the palms or feet.</li>
                    <li><b>Muscle Weakness:</b> When treating areas like the hands, some patients experience temporary muscle weakness, but this usually resolves within a few weeks.</li>
                    <li><b>Bruising or Redness:</b> Mild bruising or swelling at the injection site is possible but temporary.</li>
                    <li><b>Compensatory Sweating:</b> In rare cases, patients may experience increased sweating in other parts of the body (compensatory sweating), though this is typically mild.</li>
